# Directions

• The goal is to knock down all ten pins
• Each player has two turns of throwing the ball twice to knock down all the pins.
• If the player knocks down all the pins with the first ball, the system shows a  "strike".
• Each game consists of ten frames. If the player bowls a strike in the tenth frame, he gets two more balls.
• If the player gets 10 points in the tenth frame with the second ball, you get one more ball.
• Scoring is based on the number of pins that the player knockdown.
